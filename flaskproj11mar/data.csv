Not with Gunn's upcoming Superman movie, mind you, but with ""Creature Commandos,"" an animated series centered around a monster team going on globe-trotting missions to save the world. It may seem like a new version of Gunn's ""The Suicide Squad,"" but animated and with a team of lesser-known stature. And in several cases, ""Creature Commandos"" is exactly that. However, James Gunn, who penned all eight episodes, capitalizes on his unique skill set as a character writer/storyteller and delivers an exciting series that's sure to make this C-tier DC team into the newly minted DCU's ""A-Team"". Funnily enough, Gunn's new overhaul starts with canonizing The Suicide Squad and the Peacemaker spin-off. Following the events of ""Peacemaker,"" A.R.G.U.S. (Advanced Research Group Uniting Super-Humans) director Amanda Waller (Viola Davis, the only 'close-to-day-one' cast member to survive a whole franchise reboot) was restricted by congress to use humans from any task force missions. She enlists the late Rick Flag's father, Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo), to take a team of super-powered prisoners at Belle Reve on a mission to a US-ally country, Pokolistan. There, they must provide security for Princess Ilana Rostovic (Maria Bakalova) against an Amazonian Sorceress named Circe (Anya Chalotra) and her band of militia operatives called ""The Sons of Themyscira."" The team is made up of beings who look monstrous on the outside, but when centralized, have tragic, tortured souls. There's Doctor Phosphorus (Alan Tudyk), a radioactive skeleton with plasma flesh and a snarky attitude, and GI Robot (Sean Gunn), a robot programmed to kill Nazis, no matter what timeline and what country they appear in. In addition, there's the return of Weasel from ""The Suicide Squad,"" who is given an empathetic characterization through speaking only in grunts, growls, and whimpers. There's also an empathetic fish woman named Nina Mazursky (Zoë Chao), and, lastly, a temperamental, hard-edged corpse named The Bride (Indira Varma). Unlike all the other corpse ""Brides,"" she wants nothing to do with her Frankenstein (David Harbour), for he's an incel stalker committed to chasing her down and making her love him, no matter how many times she rebuffs throughout centuries.
